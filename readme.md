Minetest Esemics modpack.

NOTICE: The regular esem textures were taken from the fractured subgame's default mod and were made by by Kilarin and are therefor licensed CCO

Extremely special thanks to Kilarin for creating the fractured subgame and the images for esem blocks, esem ore, esem crystal, and esem crystal fragment
	
Inspired by fractured having a counterpart to mese named esem. Personaly I have always loved what people have made mese be able to do with mods like mesecons, digilines, and several other mods and mesecons addons, but they were all technology based so i thaught why not add a magical counterpart that could interface with mese technology to create something complex that beefs up and deepens the gameplay of mods like mesecons, digilines, and technic combined! The layout and function of esem is quite similar to the way Eco worked in the old Jak and Daxter game series, hence the colors. It also slows progression WAY down as a result, it ain't easy to get yourself that supremely overpowered pickaxe.

Origionally this modpack was only the esem part but then I thought why not expand upon mese and furthermore, what is this yellow stuff anyways?

The mese mod adresses the correlation between esem and the technology of mesecons and adds more decorative flare with a gameplay twist.

Celeronium is the element that mese is made of, a naturally forming polymer of celeronium that forms from an octahedral crystaline structure into a block that says mese or esem depending on if it is mese or esem. Ode to Celeron55

Guptonium, perhaps the most exotic substance that occurs when shadowmese is compressed until it fuses (TODO) and can be activated and used as fuel in a furnace which produces an almost unbreakable glasslike substance.

mobs_mese adds mese monsters for each tye of mese added by the mese mod except for corrupt and depleted mese, be careful around these because they'll kill you dead and keep beating you up, and their incredibly tough but on the bright side they can be tamed, just don't get too close at night!
TECHNICAL NOTE: mobs_mese has been a testing ground for the early stages of me experimenting with mobs_redo to add different textures for a male version of a mob and a female version, like bulls or roosters. that's what the extra fields are, see https://github.com/puzzlecube/mobs_redo

technic_corrupt adds a super powerful mese based reactor that you will have to work just to even produce its outer shell but it puts out a lot of energy for a really long time. word of warning it does have a problem with if it thinks it ever disconnects while it is running, it dies and you have to dig it causing a meltdown so before choosing the reactor, THINK ABOUT IT and if anyone has a fix for it please send a pull request with the fix and I will merge it.

TODO:
	more esem + mese chemistry.
	esem magic
	esem powering (somewhat done)
	esem vents to carry esem throughout the world
	more for guptonium and its materials
	more for celeronium than just a super bouncy block
	fix technic_corrupt reactor stopping power if any loss or fake loss of connection occurs
	configurables
	stop infernox mese monsters from being able to incinerate and burn the heck out of anything within a 20 node radius
	fully integrate purple and orange esem
	fix esemic prism
	add esem monsters or creatures of some sort(s)
	github wiki documentation
	muuuuuuuuuuuuuch muuuuuuuuuuuuch more

Last thing, a word of advice; when making esem, try not to blow everything up okay! it'll stink really bad if you make your nifty little house go away with only a block of esem in return. You have been warned (surround with depleted mese)
