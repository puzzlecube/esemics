Have you ever been playing minetest with mobs redo and thought, "Man it'd be great to have a pet mese monster or be able to farm them for mese." BOOM! Not only that but it adds a mese monster for every type of mese in my mese mod for your harvesting pleasure. They are now also tamable and breedable and they fly instead of float there which looks weird when they "jump" and now they are docile during the day too.
