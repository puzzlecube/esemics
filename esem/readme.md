Inspired by fractured having a counterpart to mese named esem. Personaly I have always loved what people have made mese be able to do with mods like mesecons, digilines, and several other mods and mesecons addons, but they were all technology based so i thaught why not add a magical counterpart that could interface with mese technology to create something more complex and astounding than mesecons, digilines, and technic combined! Thus the esem mod was born!

Currently this mod is in a very early stage. only the nodes are defined and there is A BUNCH left to do

TODO:
	esem + mese chemistry.
	esem magic
	esem powering
	esem vents to carry esem throughout the world
	esem pick (the pick that digs EVERYTHING instantly!)
	much more

The textures are all my own except for the ones for regular esem, esem ore, its crystal and its fragment. licensed CCO. those came from the default mod of the fractured subgame. fractured source code is at https://github.com/Kilarin/fractured. forum topic is at https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=11346&hilit=fractured
